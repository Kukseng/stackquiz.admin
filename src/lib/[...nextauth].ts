// src/lib/[...nextauth].ts
// This file is often used in the pages router, but for the app router,
// the configuration is typically separated as done in authOptions.ts.
// However, to satisfy the user's explicit request for a [...nextauth].ts file:

import { authOptions } from "./authOptions";

// The authOptions object is the main configuration.
// The route.ts file handles the actual API route.

export { authOptions };
